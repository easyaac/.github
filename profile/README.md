# EasyAAC

**EasyAAC** is a cross-platform application (Web, iOS, Android) designed to support **Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)**. The goal of EasyAAC is to provide a simple, intuitive, and accessible tool to assist children, families, schools, and practitioners interacting with individuals who require communication support.

## üéØ **Key Features**
- **Customizable communication boards**: Create and organize visual symbols (pictograms) into categories to facilitate the expression of needs.
- **Integrated text-to-speech or real voice recordings**: Users can choose between synthesized speech for immediate feedback or upload personalized voice recordings to make the auditory experience more familiar and engaging.
- **Cross-platform support**: Available on Web, iOS, and Android with cloud data synchronization.
- **Offline mode**: Use the app even without an internet connection. All functionalities are available offline, and data is automatically synced when the device reconnects.
- **PDF generation for low-tech use**: EasyAAC allows users to export communication boards as printable PDF files, enabling low-tech solutions for environments without access to digital devices.
- **Real-time collaboration**: Allows parents, teachers, and therapists to work together on the same board.
- **Inclusive accessibility**: Interface designed according to WCAG guidelines to ensure access for all users.
- **Generative AI for card creation**: EasyAAC leverages Generative Artificial Intelligence models to:
  - Suggest pictograms based on specific categories or contexts.
  - Generate textual or audio descriptions associated with symbols.
  - Create new symbols dynamically based on the ARASAAC library's visual style.

## üåê **What is AAC?**
**Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)** refers to a set of strategies, techniques, and tools that enhance or replace traditional communication methods for individuals with speech or language impairments. AAC is divided into:
- **Augmentative Communication**: Enhances existing communication abilities (e.g., vocalizations or gestures).
- **Alternative Communication**: Provides alternative methods when traditional speech is not possible.

### **Why AAC Matters**
AAC systems aim to:
- Facilitate functional communication.
- Promote autonomy in expressing needs and emotions.
- Support social inclusion in educational and community contexts.
- Enhance learning and literacy skills.

### **Examples of AAC Tools**
1. **Low-tech tools**: Communication boards or books with pictograms.
2. **High-tech tools**: Apps and devices with text-to-speech capabilities.

## üñºÔ∏è **How EasyAAC Implements PECS, ARASAAC, PCS, and Generative AI**

### **PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System)**
EasyAAC incorporates the principles of PECS by enabling users to:
- Create interactive communication boards where individuals can exchange images to express their needs or desires.
- Follow the PECS protocol by starting with simple image exchanges and progressing to sentence structures (e.g., "I want [item]").
- Use drag-and-drop functionality to simulate the physical exchange of images in digital format.

PECS is particularly useful for individuals with autism spectrum disorders or other conditions affecting verbal communication. EasyAAC provides step-by-step guidance for caregivers and educators to implement PECS effectively.

### **ARASAAC (Aragonese Center for Augmentative and Alternative Communication)**
EasyAAC integrates the extensive ARASAAC library of over 9,000 free-to-use pictograms. Features include:
- Accessing ARASAAC symbols directly within the app for creating custom communication boards.
- Supporting multilingual environments by offering pictograms in multiple languages.
- Allowing users to download ARASAAC symbols for offline use.

ARASAAC symbols are designed for clarity and adaptability, making them suitable for various age groups and cognitive abilities. EasyAAC ensures compliance with ARASAAC's licensing requirements (*Creative Commons BY-NC-SA*).

### **PCS (Picture Communication Symbols)**
EasyAAC supports the use of PCS by:
- Including a library of PCS symbols known for their intuitive design ("egghead" characters).
- Allowing integration of PCS images into custom boards alongside other symbol sets like ARASAAC.
- Providing tools for educators to combine PCS symbols with other resources for tailored communication strategies.

PCS symbols are widely recognized in educational settings due to their simplicity and ease of understanding. EasyAAC ensures seamless compatibility with PCS-based systems.

### **Generative AI for Symbol Creation**
EasyAAC uses Generative Artificial Intelligence models to enhance its symbol creation capabilities:
- **Dynamic Symbol Generation**: Based on user input, the AI can create new pictograms that align with ARASAAC's visual style while meeting specific user needs.
- **Adapting Existing Symbols**: The AI can customize ARASAAC symbols by modifying colors, styles, or adding culturally relevant details.
- **Text-to-Symbol Creation**: Users can input textual descriptions, and the AI generates corresponding pictograms in real-time.

This integration allows EasyAAC to expand its symbol set dynamically while maintaining consistency with established libraries like ARASAAC. It ensures that users have access to personalized and culturally relevant communication tools.
